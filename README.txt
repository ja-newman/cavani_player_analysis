README: Edinson Cavani Player Analysis:

This is a light piece of work for a solo analytics project. I am not a sports analyst, but an avid watcher.
As an introduction to API's, I used API football to request data from the 15-16 and 16-17 seasons of
Edinson Cavani, one of my favorite players, to illustrate his dramatically evolved style of play, having
been reverted to a Striker, having played on the left wing during the tenure of Zlatan Ibrahimovic.

While not naturally a winger, according to the stats (and my chart), Cavani exhibited more winger-like statistics,
such as higher rates of dribbling and a tendancy to contribute assists rather than goal during 15-16, which saw a complete inversion
in the following season, with a far greater contribution of goals and shot attempts in his natural position, 
whilst seemingly being less involved in build-up play.
